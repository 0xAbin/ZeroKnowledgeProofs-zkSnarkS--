# Zero-Knowledge-Proofs-ZKP-
Testing for Project

This code defines a function statement() that represents the statement that we want to prove to the verifier. In this case, the statement is that we know the value of a secret number. We also define a function generate_challenge() that generates a random challenge value, and a function provide_proof() that represents the proof that we provide to the verifier in response to the challenge.

In the main() function, we simulate the Zero Knowledge Proof protocol by generating a challenge value, providing a proof in response to the challenge, and checking the proof to see if it is valid. If the proof is valid, the verifier can be convinced that the statement is true.

This is just a simple example to illustrate the basic idea of a Zero Knowledge Proof. In practice, Zero Knowledge Proofs can be much more complex and involve more sophisticated techniques for generating challenges and providing proofs.
